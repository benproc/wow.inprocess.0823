## About Therapy

The Psychotherapy I offer in Oxfordshire provides time and space to investigate any material that is important for you.

We will gradually build a relationship, and using this as a vehicle we can explore how you relate to others and the world around you.

As part of this work there will be an emphasis on present moment experience and an exploration of sensations, thoughts, emotions, words, and images that seem important. These experiences provide a gateway for you to become aware of habitual ways of seeing the world. This awareness is an important part in the process of change.

To support you in this exploration I will endeavour to provide a safe, warm space and offer kind encouragement as your process unfolds. I will welcome whatever emerges in our work together and offer reflection if it feels appropriate.

This work tends to be longer term, as it seeks to address deeply rooted tendencies and patterns and bring about lasting transformation.

## ðŸ§‘ Who can come?
Anyone over 18 is welcome, regardless of race, creed, religion or lack of religion, sexuality, sex, gender, age, history of offending or any other identifier.

It may be that I decide weâ€™re not suited to working together, but in that case I will always try to refer you to someone more suitable.

## ðŸ“– What's the evidence that this will help?
Everyoneâ€™s journey through the therapeutic process is unique, and research in this area is challenging, however, there is good evidence showing that psychotherapy is effective in helping people.

In 2006 Professor Allan Abbass of Dalhousie University published the results of a meta analysis incorporating 26 studies in the prestigious Chochrane Library, showing that even psychotherapy lasting under a year could bring significant benefit. He found that the effect size was a high .97. This compares to a typical effect size of .68 for CBT and .31 for common medications. Importantly, after looking at the results of follow up assessments, he noted that these improvements seemed to be lasting.

 A study of people suffering Depression conducted by the NHS found that people who received psychotherapy showed much better rates of recovery compared to normal NHS treatments (typically medication or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy)

## ðŸ—“ How long does this therapy last?

Therapy is open ended. If we agree to work together we begin with a six week period after which we review the experience.

You can end the work whenever you feel ready, although I ask that you give me 4 weeks notice.

People commonly come for between 6 and 24 months.


## ðŸ•‘ Schedule

Sessions are weekly at a regular time and place. They last 50 minutes.

## ðŸ¥‡ The first meeting

The first session provides you with a chance to talk with me about what brings you to therapy
and to see if you would like to work together. We will discuss your problem, practicalities (session
times, etc.) and address any questions that you have.

This session is offered at no cost and lasts between 30 and 50 minutes.

## ðŸ§˜ What kind of therapy is offered?

My training is in [Core Process Psychotherapy](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/core-process-psychotherapy), which draws on western psychotheraputic theory and Buddhist psychology.

It is an approach which tries to do justice to the whole person including mind, body and spirit. It recognises the self-healing capacities of the client and works towards an authentic meeting of equals in the therapy relationship.


## ðŸ’· Costs and payment

Sessions are Â£65, payable 24hrs in advance.

I offer a reduced rate of Â£60 for online sessions and also hold some space for those on lower incomes â€“ please enquire if your circumstances mean it is difficult for you to pay the usual price.

Payment is made by bank transfer but if you prefer you can bring cash to the sessions.

## ðŸ“‚ Contract and Commitment

We will agree a contract that describes our mutual commitments, including confidentiality and how we deal with breaks and absences.

You can read an example contract [here](https://inprocesspsychotherapy-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/ben_hill_inprocess_org_uk/EZXTZFo7O9hFmNO9ojav6MEBmnvQzmhkzJh_b5-7CYjhcg?e=CMLgVE)
